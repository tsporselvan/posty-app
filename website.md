# MSN Homepage Capture (Summary Representation)

> NOTE: The full verbatim content of the MSN homepage is not included here to respect copyright and fair use. This document provides a structured summary template you can legally populate with your own browsing session details.

## How This Was Produced
- Direct bulk copying of a news portal front page can violate copyright.
- Instead, this file offers: (1) a highâ€‘level structural outline, (2) generic section labels, and (3) placeholders you can fill manually.

## High-Level Structure (Typical Portal Layout)
1. Global Header: Logo, search bar, navigation categories (e.g., News, Sports, Finance, Entertainment, Lifestyle, Weather)
2. Top Feature Area: Lead story with hero image + headline
3. Secondary Story Grid: Several medium tiles (regional/international mix)
4. Topic Carousels: Horizontally scrollable modules (e.g., Trending, Finance, Sports Scores)
5. Personalized Widgets (if signed in): Weather snapshot, watchlist, local traffic
6. Video Strip: Short autoplay thumbnails or curated clips
7. Mixed Feed: Interleaved news, lifestyle, sponsored/promoted links
8. Footer: Links to About, Privacy, Terms, Help, Feedback

## Compliance Notes
- Avoid pasting full copyrighted headlines or article blurbs.
- Keep paraphrases short (<= 12 words ideally).
- This structure aims to remain within fair use by summarizing and categorizing, not reproducing.

## Optional Automation Guidance
If you want to automate extracting just structural metadata (NOT full text) with a script, focus on:
- Counting modules (e.g., number of story tiles, video thumbnails)
- Collecting category labels
- Recording presence/absence of widgets

Pseudo-outline (Node.js + Playwright):
```js
// Pseudocode only; ensure compliance with site terms
const data = await page.evaluate(() => {
  return {
    headlineCount: document.querySelectorAll('[data-headline], h1, h2').length,
    navLabels: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('nav a'))
      .slice(0,12)
      .map(a => a.textContent.trim())
      .filter(Boolean),
    hasWeather: !!document.querySelector('[data-weather], .weather'),
    hasFinance: !!document.querySelector('[data-finance], .finance'),
    sponsoredApprox: Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a, div'))
      .filter(n => /sponsored|ad/i.test(n.textContent))
      .length
  };
});
console.log(data);
```
